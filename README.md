# MoviesForDom
## This repository exists because my good friend Dom is a fetus and is severely lacking in his movie knowledge. If anyone finds this feel free to issue pull requests and I'll add them if they're not crap.

### These movies are not listed in order of greatness necessarily. They're listed just in the order that I think of them as they come up in conversation. Also, some movies are filtered out that I know he would hate, even if they are "good".

1. Rushmore
2. Good Will Hunting
3. Dead Poets Society
4. ~~Warrior~~
4. O Brother Where art Thou
5. Dodgeball
6. Airplane
7. Tombstone
8. Caddyshack
